# TruncatedFisher

This is an R file for computing truncated Fisher's logseries model, which can be used to extraploate regional species richness from local samples. The introduction of the truncated model is to avoid the occurrence of extremely rare species like singleton or doubleton species at the global scales. These species are biologically impossible or already functionally extinct and therefore are less informative for biodiversity prediction.
